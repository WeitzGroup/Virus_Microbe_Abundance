Marine Virus Abundance
======================

Global earth systems and climate models attempt to integrate geophysical processes with the biology of microbes
to metazoans to predict the dynamics of carbon and biogeochemical cycles and of biodiversity. However, the smallest
biotic agents on the planet - viruses - are rarely, if ever, included in such models, despite empirical evidence 
that viruses may have dramatic consequences on model predictions. Viruses infect and kill bacteria, archaea and 
microeukaryotes at the base of the ocean's food web. Viral-induced mortality of microbes releases carbon and other
nutrients back into the environment and, as a consequence, redirects these materials away from higher trophic 
levels (e.g. plankton and fish). Theoretical work on aquatic viruses is in its infancy and has not yet resolved 
the quantitative effects of viruses on carbon and other biogeochemical cycles.

The work presented on this page is the result of the work of the NIMBIOS Ocean Viral Dynamics working group, 
whose goal is identifying and devising analytical approaches to quantifying viral effects on the biogeochemical
dynamics of carbon and other key nutrients in the oceans. The page includes: (i) a rigorous analysis 
of marine sample data; (ii) reasons to call into question the use of 10:1 ratio to describe the relationship 
between viruses and microbes from marine environments, i.e. that for marine samples, one can expect to observe 
marine viruses to be an order of magnitude more abundant than marine microbes.
