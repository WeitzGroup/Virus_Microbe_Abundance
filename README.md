Marine Virus Abundance
======================
The work presented on this page is in part the result of work by the NIMBIOS Ocean Viral Dynamics working group, 
whose goal is identifying and devising analytical approaches to quantifying viral effects on the biogeochemical
dynamics of carbon and other key nutrients in the oceans. 

The files in this repo allow users to recreate updated versions of the figures presented in the bioRxiv article, **Re-examining the relationship between virus and microbial cell abundances in the global oceans** available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/025544.
